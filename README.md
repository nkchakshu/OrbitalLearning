# OrbitalLearning
This is the library for orbital system platform, designed for decentralised learning across various data points. This platform is capable of,
- Handling almost all types of data distribution (including imbalanced and non-independent and identically distributed).
- Preventing data tampering from affecting global learning.
- Protect data privacy.
- Detect index cases of novel/rare diseases.

NOTE: This library consists of simple pearson correlation as agents for assessing activity of each satellite node. Further versions will include advanced agents for the same.

Glossary-
-Planet node - Central server for orchestrating global model training, testing, benchmarking, deployment, orbit creation, maintainence and satellite node movement(s) between orbits.
-Satellite node - Hospital units housing local patient data and training models locally (completely or partially). No data is dessiminated from them.
